# AWS Ramp-Up Guide to CSV

[AWS Ramp-Up Guides](https://aws.amazon.com/training/ramp-up-guides/)

Take a PDF ramp-up guide and convert it to a CSV file.

The idea behind is: I want it in csv to mark the items I've already done and to keep track of my progress.

TODO

  - why pandas sometimes include the start bound, sometimes the upper bound or sometimes both
- [ ] Refactor code
  - More clean
